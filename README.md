## Description
Spirit Realm is an endless side scroller game based on folklore legends. The first level of the game is based on a Will-O-Wisp spirit. The legend talks about how travelers encounter an atmospheric ghost light when traveling at night, especially near bogs, swamps or marshes. In the first level the player will help guide a Will-O-Wisp spirit through a bog while avoiding other bog creatures. Once the player reaches a score of 10,0000 they have successfully completed the first level!

## Motivation 
My motivation for creating Spirit Realm comes from my love of playing endless side scroller games and my interest in folklore and ghost stories. In the future I hope to expand on the game and create more levels based on other spirits and folklore legends.
