Description
Willow the wisp is an endless side scroller game based on the folklore legend of the Will-o-the-Wisp bog spirit. The legend talks about how travellers encounter an atmospheric ghost light when travelling at night, especially near bogs, swamps or marshes. In the game the player helps guide Willow the spirit through a bog while avoiding other creatures. The goal of the game is to reach the highest score that you can as the creature obstacles move towards you and speed up overtime. Once you reach a score of XXXXXXX you have successfully completed the game!

Motivation 
My motivation for creating Willow the wisp comes from my love of playing endless side scroller games and interest in folklore and ghost stories. In the future I would love to expand on the game and create more levels that explore other spirits and characters based on folklore legends.
