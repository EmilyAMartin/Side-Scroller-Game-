        Spirit Realm is an endless side scroller game based on the ghost ledgends. The first level of the game is based on a Will-O-Wisp spirit.
        The legend talks about how travellers encounter an atmospheric ghost light when travelling at night, especially near bogs, swamps or marshes. 
        In the first level the player helps guide a Will-O-Wisp spirit through a bog while avoiding other bog creatures. Once the player reaches a 
        score of 10,0000 they have successfully completed the first level! My motivation for creating Spirit Realm comes from my love of playing endless 
        side scroller games and my interest in folklore and ghost stories. In the future I hope to expand on the game and create more levels based on 
        other spirits and folklore legends.
